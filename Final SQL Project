#For this project, I downloaded a file from a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.
#I came up with my own questions that I wanted to learn more about from the dataset.


#Show customers that are from the United States.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerID, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';

#How many invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '01-01-2009' AND '12-31-2009';

#Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent.
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

#Provide a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.Name, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.Tracks t 
ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId;

#Show employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT * FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent";

#Find a distinct list of billing countries from the invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry FROM chinook.Invoices;
